 * This interface will obligate any troll objects to 
 * implement the methods found in this interface. Perhaps
 * only Trolls could have the ability to smash. I see mention
 * of a cooldown time on the discussion forums. Maybe, for a larger
 * creature like a Troll (or whatever else would be a better fit for a 
 * large creature) the cooldown time would be longer because the
 * destruction is greater.
